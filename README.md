# Althea

### Summary
Althea, a forest sprite, adventures through new areas with the help of the forest shrines. You must bring crystalline flower petals to the shrines to open up new parts of the forest. As you bring the petals to the shrines and unlock new areas, Althea gains new abilities, which allow her to maneuver to and through the new areas of the forest.

Watch the forest come alive as you carry on your journey!
